# USA-McWalBucks
Visualizing America by its Consumption of Walmart, McDonalds, and Starbucks

All of the spatial data is crowdsourced from a GPS repository called [POI Factory](http://www.poi-factory.com/).  Walmart's data, which is in XML format, contains syntax error which cannot be parsed noramlly.  I wrote extra code to parse it manually, basically.

The way I reorganized this project is so that all the output can be generated by running only one of the six scripts by utilizing `source()`.  The "mapMcWalBucks.R" plots the maps, but it also runs all the dependent scripts as well.  Three of the scrips prefixed with "clean" wrangle the data files located in folder /data for each company and prepare the data to be visualized.  Another simply calls the R packages needed like `dplyr` and `ggplot`.

It's cool to see how Starbucks os the most urbanized of the three while Walmart is more evenly distributed across the country (probably due to space requirements).  McDonalds is clearly highly conentrated in cities, but has so many store units that it still covers the whole nation.

Moving forward, I would like to work on animating Walmart's expansion (maybe correlated with its stockprice) using a package called `animation`.  Referencing my previous observations, it would be interesting to work with spatial statistics package, `statspat`.
